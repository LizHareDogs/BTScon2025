# BTScon2025 Big Team Science 2025 slides on code review at @ropensci. 
Yanina BelliniSaibene and Liz Hare

The Big Team Science Conference is October 6-8, 2025. 

Our talk is given 25 minutes, but we want to make sure 
to leave time for questions.

This repo is private now, but will be public so we can 
use GitHub Pages to make the slides available.
